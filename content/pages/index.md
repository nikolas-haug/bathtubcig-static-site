Bathtub cig is the intimate depression pop project of Hilary James.  Born in a Minneapolis bedroom, it is an honest attempt at coping with her long struggle with mental health.  She is joined by Dave Power on drums, Skyler Nowinski on bass, and Hannah Heble on synth, flute and harmony.

Their 2018 debut EP “Old Light” draws comparisons to a synth-pop version of Frankie Cosmo with raw lyrics.  2021 Ep “bed” is both a dream-like and hazy musing on quarantine as well as a heartbreaking attempt to cope with grief.  In a departure from James’ first full band EP “Old Light”, “bed” is a stripped down solo voyage.  Hilary is joined by Addie Strei (Adelyn Rose) on clarinet, flute, and bass to create beautiful textures to balance out the loneliness of the electric guitar.  Their 2022 debut full length “Night Blindness” has been described as a clever and dark Gen Z Ode, putting our hardest thoughts into music.

Their newest single “Red Pine” is a determinedly joyous sapphic bop about falling in love despite the inevitable risk of loss.  The song has been described in the press as “an exceptional piece of art” and “gorgeous vocals and some guitar work with a bit of a Big Thief quality that expands and delights with an emotional sensitivity”.

On September 5, 2024 bathtub cig will release “Good Mourning, I Love you”. This EP is about love during a time of immense grief- the death of Hilary’s mom.
